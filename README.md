# Angular splitform

This is part of a blogpost I wrote to show how you can create a form with several steps using angular.js.

To run this example on your local machine you will need to have [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) installed. When you've installed bower just run `bower install` from the root folder of this project to set up the dependencies and you're good to go.
